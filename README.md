01-Knapsack Solvers
===================

This project includes both a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing approach to solving the 01-Knapsack problem. Both take command-line user inputs, and are intended to be run on datasets in the format of those hosted at http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/knapsack_01/knapsack_01.html. Another program (KnapsackGenerator) is included which allows both toy problems and random problems to be generated.
 
The genetic algorithm provides the following operators to choose from:
 - Roulette Selection
 - Tournament Selection
 - N-Slice Crossover
 - Uniform Crossover
 - N-Point Mutation
 - Bit-Inversion Mutation

The simulated annealing allows the testing parameters to be set at the start of each run.
